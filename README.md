# Shapes Showcase

## Description 

Showcase of shapes, position, and color design 

# Installation 

Without the implemation of repeating (such as factory), I created the first initial shape that would be on the bottonm layer of the rest of the shapes and be the only one of its color. I corrected its position in the div style elements and copied and pasted each ball afterwards, editing their position and layers as I continued. I made sure all my colors were compatible and were themed with the color green. 

# Support 

for all colors, i made sure they were html compatible, and used the correct name or hexadecimal values, with the help of the following website:

# Roadmap 
Better to implement some sort of factory functions to create a similar pattern to help me save time and coding space.
